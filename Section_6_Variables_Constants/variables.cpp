/*Simply declaring variables

 Setting variables standard and as input
 int age {18};   This is list initialization for compile errors for overflow

 Global variables
    Not good practice to use global variables all over your code

 Primitive Data Types

 Character Types
 Integer Types
    signed by default
    unsigned keyword needed

    short int
    int
    long int
    long long int

 Floating-point Types

    float
    double
    long double

 Boolean Type
    true (any nonzero)
    false (zero)


sizeof operator

#include <climits>

ex.
    sizeof(int)
    sizeof(double)

    sizeof(some_variable) ** Parenthesis optional
    sizeof some_variable

CONSTANTS

  1. have names
  2. Occupy storage
  3. Are usually typed

  Literal Constants
  number literal constants
  Character literal constants

  Declare:
    const double pi {3.145926};

  Defined constants are not used in modern C++
    ex. #define pi 3.145926
